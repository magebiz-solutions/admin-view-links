Managing a web shops with multiple websites, store views, and localized content is powerful—but it comes with complexity. One of the most common frustrations for admins, merchandisers, and developers is figuring out whether a product, category, or CMS page is actually accessible on the frontend.

For years, the only way to verify this was to manually check the SEO tab, inspect the URL Key, switch between store views, and hope the entity was enabled and correctly linked. This process is slow, error-prone, and confusing—especially when working across multiple languages like French, German, or Dutch, where localized URL Keys differ per store view.

This extension for Magento solves the exact problem. It adds a simple, intuitive “Front View” button to all major entity edit pages in the Admin panel. With one click, you can instantly preview the frontend rendering of the entity—no guesswork, no manual URL hunting.

Why This Matters

It has multi-store architecture is a strength, but it also introduces complexity. Each store view can have its own URL Key, visibility settings, and enablement status. This is great for SEO and localization, but it makes it hard to answer a simple question:

“Can customers actually see this page?”

FEATURES

Whether the entity is enabled
Whether it has a valid frontend URL
Whether it’s accessible in the current store view
And if so, lets you visit it instantly
Better SEO control: Confirm localized URLs are live and correct
Reduced errors: Avoid publishing disabled or inaccessible entities
Merchandiser-friendly: Quickly preview product and category pages during setup
Supported Entities:

The plugin currently supports the following entities:

Product Edit Pages
Category Edit Pages
CMS Page Edit Pages
Base URLs (global visibility across all pages)
On each of these pages, the plugin adds a “Front View” button. If the entity is enabled and has a valid URL in the current store view, the button is active and clickable. If the entity is disabled or lacks a valid frontend path, the button is disabled—giving you immediate clarity.

This process is tedious and error-prone. Worse, if the entity is disabled or misconfigured, you might not even realize it until customers report broken links or missing pages.

The Admin View Links plugin eliminates this entire workflow. It adds a context-aware button that tells you.

Multi-Store Support:

For entities with different URL Keys across store views (e.g., localized product URLs in FR, DE, NL), the plugin intelligently detects and displays the correct frontend link for each store. You’ll see a Button List showing all available store views where the entity is active, each with its store button.
